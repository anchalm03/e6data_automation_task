# Automation Task Project

This project contains a Python script that automates a series of web interactions using Selenium WebDriver. The script logs into a specified application, navigates through various UI elements, and performs a series of tasks as outlined in the accompanying `TASK.md`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3
- Selenium WebDriver
- ChromeDriver (or any other driver for your preferred browser, matched with the browser version)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages:
`pip install selenium python-dotenv`
3. Ensure you have ChromeDriver installed and its path correctly set up in your environment variables, or specify its path in the `.env` file.

## Running the Script

To run the script, navigate to the project directory and execute:
`python automation_script.py`
Replace `automation_script.py` with the path to the script if you're running it from another directory.
